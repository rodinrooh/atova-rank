# White Squares Not Visible Issue

## Problem Statement

Two white squares were added to the page but they are not visible/rendering.

### Current Behavior
- Two white squares were added with the code:
  ```tsx
  <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
  <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
  ```
- The squares are placed in a flex container with `justify-center` and `gap-4`
- The squares are supposed to be 256px x 256px (w-64 h-64), white background
- User reports they cannot see the squares at all

### Expected Behavior
- Two white squares should be visible below the separator line
- Squares should be centered on the page with a small gap between them
- Squares should be large (256px x 256px)
- White background should contrast with the #f6f6f6 page background

## Technical Context

### Framework
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Current Implementation

**File**: `atova-rank/app/(public)/page.tsx`

The white squares are added in the render section around line 412-416:

```tsx
return (
  <main className="min-h-screen bg-[#f6f6f6]">
    <section className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-24 md:py-32">
      <div className="text-center">
        {/* Clock timer */}
        <time
          role="timer"
          aria-live="polite"
          className="
            block
            font-black
            leading-none
            tabular-nums
            select-none
            text-[clamp(2.5rem,8vw,6rem)]
            tracking-[-0.1em]
            font-['Inter']
          "
        >
          {timeRemaining}
        </time>
      </div>

      {/* Grey separator line */}
      <div className="my-8 h-[2px] w-full bg-[#e5e5e5]" />

      {/* Two white squares */}
      <div className="flex justify-center gap-4">
        <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
        <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
      </div>
    </section>
  </main>
)
```

### Global CSS

**File**: `atova-rank/app/globals.css`

The page background is set to `#f6f6f6`, so the white squares (using `bg-white` which is `#ffffff`) should be visible.

There are CSS resets in the globals.css that might be affecting things:

```css
html, body, #__next {
  margin: 0 !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
}

main {
  margin-top: 0 !important;
  padding-top: 0 !important;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  margin-block: 0 !important;
}
```

## Potential Issues

### 1. **Section Container Issues**
The white squares are inside a `<section>` that has:
- `max-w-4xl` - max width constraint
- `mx-auto` - center horizontally
- `px-4` - horizontal padding
- `py-24 md:py-32` - vertical padding

The section might be constraining the width or causing issues.

### 2. **Flex Container Issues**
The flex container with `justify-center gap-4` should work, but there might be:
- No explicit height on the parent container
- The parent section might not be taking full width
- The squares might be rendering but white on white (unlikely since page is #f6f6f6)

### 3. **CSS Conflicts**
There might be global CSS resets affecting the display of divs:
- The `* { }` selector in globals.css might be resetting display properties
- The `all: unset` pattern might be removing div behavior

### 4. **Empty Div Issue**
Empty divs without content might collapse or have zero height/width. However, `w-64 h-64` should give them dimensions.

### 5. **Section vs Main Issue**
The squares are inside `<section>` which is inside `<main>`. There might be layout issues with how these stack.

## Debugging Steps to Try

1. **Add border to see if boxes exist**: Try adding a visible border to confirm if the divs are rendering at all:
   ```tsx
   <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64 border-2 border-red-500"></div>
   ```

2. **Check if parent container has proper width**: The section might not be taking full width, add:
   ```tsx
   <section className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-24 md:py-32 w-full">
   ```

3. **Add explicit content**: Empty divs might collapse, try adding placeholder text:
   ```tsx
   <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64">Test</div>
   ```

4. **Check browser DevTools**: Inspect to see if:
   - Elements are rendering in the DOM
   - Computed styles are correct
   - Elements have proper dimensions
   - Elements are visible but positioned off-screen

5. **Verify Tailwind is processing**: Check if `bg-white w-64 h-64` classes are in the compiled CSS

## Suggested Fix

The most likely issue is that the section container needs `w-full` or the flex container needs explicit width. Try this:

```tsx
{/* Two white squares */}
<div className="w-full flex justify-center gap-4">
  <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64 flex items-center justify-center">
    Test
  </div>
  <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64 flex items-center justify-center">
    Test
  </div>
</div>
```

Or alternatively, if the issue is that the section is constraining things, move the squares outside:

```tsx
<main className="min-h-screen bg-[#f6f6f6]">
  <section className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-24 md:py-32">
    {/* Clock */}
  </section>
  
  {/* Grey separator line - outside section */}
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4">
    <div className="my-8 h-[2px] w-full bg-[#e5e5e5]" />
  </div>

  {/* Two white squares - outside section */}
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4">
    <div className="flex justify-center gap-4">
      <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
      <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

## Additional Context

### Previous Changes
- The clock timer is working and displaying correctly
- The separator line is working and visible
- The page background is #f6f6f6 as expected
- All previous styling and layout has been working

### Related Files
- `atova-rank/app/globals.css` - Contains global styles and resets
- `atova-rank/app/(public)/page.tsx` - Main page component
- No other components are imported or being used

### User Intent
The user wants two simple white squares below the separator, nothing fancy. They explicitly asked for:
- No rounded corners
- No borders
- No content inside
- Just two white squares with a gap

## Code Location

The white squares are in `atova-rank/app/(public)/page.tsx` starting at line 412:

```tsx:412:416:atova-rank/app/(public)/page.tsx
      {/* Two white squares */}
      <div className="flex justify-center gap-4">
        <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
        <div className="bg-white w-64 h-64"></div>
      </div>
```
